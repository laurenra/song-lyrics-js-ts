Hail to the brightness of Zion’s glad mor
Joy to the lands that in darkness have lai
Hushed be the accents of sorrow and mo
Zion in triumph begins her glad reign.


Hail to the brightness of Zion’s glad mor
Long by the prophets of Israel foretold!
Hail to the millions from bondage return
Gentiles and Jews the glad vision behold


Lo! in the desert the flowers are springin
Streams, ever copious, are gliding along.
Loud from the mountaintops echoes aren
Wastes rise in verdure and mingle in son.


Hark! from all lands, from the isles of th
Praise to Jehovah ascending on high.
Fallen the engines of war and commotioi
Shouts of salvation are rending the sky.
