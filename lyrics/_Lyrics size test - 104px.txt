Hail to the brightness of Zion’s glad morn
Joy to the lands that in darkness have lain!
Hushed be the accents of sorrow and mou
Zion in triumph begins her glad reign.


Hail to the brightness of Zion’s glad morn
Long by the prophets of Israel foretold!
Hail to the millions from bondage returni
Gentiles and Jews the glad vision behold.


Lo! in the desert the flowers are springing
Streams, ever copious, are gliding along.
Loud from the mountaintops echoes are ri
Wastes rise in verdure and mingle in song.


Hark! from all lands, from the isles of thei
Praise to Jehovah ascending on high.
Fallen the engines of war and commotion;
Shouts of salvation are rending the sky.
