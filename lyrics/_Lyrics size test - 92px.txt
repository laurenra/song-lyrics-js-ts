Abide with me!
Fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens.
Lord, with me abide!
When other helpers 
fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, oh, 
abide with me!


Swift to its close 
ebbs out life’s little day.
Earth’s joys grow dim; 
its glories pass away.
Change and decay in 
all around I see;
O thou who changest not, 
abide with me!


I need thy presence 
ev’ry passing hour.
What but thy grace can 
foil the tempter’s pow’r?
Who, like thyself, my 
guide and stay can be?
Thru cloud and sunshine, Lord, 
abide with me!
