Hail to the brightness of Zion’s glad mornin
Joy to the lands that in darkness have lain!
Hushed be the accents of sorrow and mourn
Zion in triumph begins her glad reign.


Hail to the brightness of Zion’s glad mornin
Long by the prophets of Israel foretold!
Hail to the millions from bondage returning
Gentiles and Jews the glad vision behold.


Lo! in the desert the flowers are springing;
Streams, ever copious, are gliding along.
Loud from the mountaintops echoes are rin
Wastes rise in verdure and mingle in song.


Hark! from all lands, from the isles of the o
Praise to Jehovah ascending on high.
Fallen the engines of war and commotion;
Shouts of salvation are rending the sky.
